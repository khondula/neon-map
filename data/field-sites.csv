Stream Description
Despite the large watershed size (2,875 kilometers2), the Arikaree is a small, wadeable stream that drains tall-grass prairie and flows through a sand-alluvial basin. The stream is largely fed by surface precipitation and is subject to flooding when large, localized storms occur in the watershed. The Arikaree flows primarily during the winter, and often dries completely during summer due to dry conditions and groundwater withdrawals for irrigation. 
Site Management
The Arikaree site is located on Nature Conservancy land that is maintained as an active cattle ranch but is also managed to ensure a diverse tall-grass prairie and bird community persists.
Site Specific Topics
NEON collects a standard suite of aquatic data at Arikaree; however, data collected at this site captures regional hydrological change and may lead to a better understanding of climate change trends in the area.
Vegetation
Land cover at the Arikaree site is dominated by grasslands with a few trees located near the stream edge. Cottonwood trees cover 30% of the ground in the surrounding area; willow trees cover 10% at the stream bank. During mid-summer, the stream channel is dominated by cattails (Typha sp.).

Surface area, elevation & depth
Pringle Creek is located at an altitude of 242 meters and drains a watershed of 18.1 km2 of mixed oak forest, savanna, and riparian woodland. Portions of the Pringle Creek watershed are protected by the Caddo-LBJ National Grassland.
Geological characteristics
Pringle Creek is a low gradient sandy-bottomed stream. Due to this sandy substrate the stream banks are highly erodible. The primary soils of the Wise County area surrounding Pringle Creek are comprised of gently sloping neutral to slightly acidic soils formed from weathered sandstones and shales on upland and terrace savannahs (Ressel, 1989). The Truce-Cona and Windthorst-Chaney-Seldon series soils of the Pringle Creek watershed are deep, loamy, and sandy moderately well drained to well drained soils underlain by shaly clay, mud, or sand-stone material from the early Cretaceous (USDA, 1989).
Water flow
The surface water flow regime of Pringle Creek has similar attributes that that of semi-arid waterways. Stream discharge exhibits strong seasonal patterns, with the greatest base and pulse flows observed in mid to late spring (May through June). Throughout the rest of the year, base flows remain low but episodic high flow events associated with storms may occur at any point. Areas of the stream dry up significantly during the summer leaving behind disconnected standing pools. This seasonal drying may be exacerbated by nearby ground and surface water withdrawals for irrigation.
Nearby land management
Land use in the Pringle Creek watershed consists of a mosaic of grassland, cropland, light urban development and deciduous forest. The grasslands in the watershed are managed for wildfire using prescribed burns every 3-4 years.
Vegetation
The dense riparian canopy surrounding Pringle Creek is a mixed oak forest. Dominant species of the mixed oak forest area include post oak and black-jack oak. However, the savannah portions of watershed are dominated by little blue stem co-associated with big blue stem and Indiangrass (USDA, 2009).

REDB,UT,Red Butte Creek,Great Basin,40.78374,-111.79765,Wadeable Stream,"Red Butte Creek is NEON’s Core Aquatics site for the Great Basin (D15). The creek flows down the east-west trending Red Butte Canyon through the Wasatch Mountains and opens into the Salt Lake Valley. Red Butte Creek once served as the primary water source for the U.S. Army’s Fort Douglas. Red Butte Canyon is held by the U.S. Forest Service and is designated as a Research Natural Area (RNA) which is closed to public access. As a largely pristine watershed at the urban-wilderness interface, NEON’s data from Red Butte Creek will inform researchers and decision makers on changes to the health of this and other Great Basin watersheds. Learn more about NEON’s data collection methods.

Surface area, elevation
The drainage area that feeds Red Butte Creek is just over 8 square miles. The canyon itself is around 5.5 miles long with an elevation gain of 3215 feet from the canyon mouth at 5020 feet above sea level to the top of the canyon at 8235 feet.
Geological characteristics
Red Butte Canyon cuts a path down the western slope of the Wasatch Mountain range, which sits at the far eastern edge of the Basin and Range province, as it intersects with the Rocky Mountains above Salt Lake City, UT. While often considered to be the westernmost range of the Middle Rocky Mountains, the Wasatch share structural characteristics of the Basin and Range mountains found to their west. One of these characteristics is the steep normal fault running along their western edge which helped them rise and formed the steep slopes that Red Butte Canyon bisects. The Wasatch are a very young mountain range and are still rising at around 1mm per year, as they have for roughly the past 11 million years.  They are made up of shale and siltstone from the Triassic period.
Red Butte Canyon holds keys to Utah’s past, with the oldest rocks present having been formed millions of years ago during the Mississippian Period, when Utah looked very different from today. Over the eons what is now Red Butte Canyon has been a sea of varying depths, as well as a desert, and many landscapes and ecosystems in between. This is evident in the rocks found underlying and protruding from the canyon, most of which are varieties of sandstone, shale, limestone, and quartzite.
These rocks strongly influence the soil profile of Red Butte Canyon, with related soils often found surrounding the rocks units that weathered to create them. These soils vary in depth from just under 8 feet deep to 2 feet or less, with a large variety of grain sizes represented. Ehleringer et. al. (1992) describe them as, “neutral to slightly basic, [soils] vary in color from brick red to dark brown, with textures generally ranging from sandy to loamy clays.”
Water flow
Red Butte Creek is a free-flowing perennial stream from its headwaters near 8200 feet in elevation to around 5400 feet, when it flows into Red Butte Reservoir, then out through Red Butte Garden, and into Salt Lake City. While it is no longer a source of drinking water for the Salt Lake Valley, several recreational areas, such as the pond in Liberty Park, are fed by it. NEON’s data collection in Red Butte Creek takes place upstream of the reservoir from an altitude of around 5640 feet to 5460 feet. The water flow in Red Butte Creek is strongly influenced by seasonal trends such as the snowpack and precipitation, and base flow is maintained by groundwater inputs throughout the stream. The water is clear and quite alkaline with a high mineral content and high conductivity. The flow varies dramatically throughout the year and has high year-to-year variability as well. At the United States Geological Survey gauge station, just downstream of NEON’s study area, stream discharge has been measured for over 50 years, and has varied from less than one cubic foot per second to over 100 cubic feet per second.
Nearby land management
As with much of the Wasatch Mountains, Red Butte Canyon is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Red Butte Canyon is unique in the area, however, for its designation as a Research Natural Area. With few exceptions, only researchers with prior permission are allowed in the canyon, leaving it more pristine than other canyons and watersheds in the area. In addition, the reservoir in Red Butte Canyon is managed by the Central Utah Water Conservancy District to protect the population of endangered June Sucker (Chasmistes liorus) that have been introduced the lake.
Vegetation
Red Butte Canyon has several distinct plant communities occupying different niches. The mouth of the canyon sits in the Salt Lake Valley, with dominant vegetation reminiscent of that in the rest of the eastern Great Basin. As the canyon rises, it transitions through different vegetative zones until it enters a conifer community that resembles the southern Rocky Mountains.
The grass-forb community at the mouth of the canyon includes Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), Bluebunch Wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata), Big Sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata), Antelope Bitterbrush (Pursha tridentata), and Broom Snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae). At the bottom of the canyon lies a riparian zone covered by a canopy of Box Elder (Acer negundo) and Cottonwood (Populus spp.) trees. Under this, numerous smaller trees such as Chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), Dogwood (Cornus sericea), and Water Birch (Betula occidentalis) intermix with Wild Mint (Mentha arvensis), Goldenrod (Salidago spp.), and Horsetails (Equisetum spp.) along the water’s edge.
Red Butte Canyon’s walls rise out of the riparian zone into a community dominated by Gambel Oak (Quercus gambelii) and Bigtooth Maple (Acer grandidentatum). Oregon Grape (Mahonia repens) spreads under this canopy, and grasses and forbs fill in areas where the canopy breaks letting light through. As the elevation rises, Curl-leaf Mountain Mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) begins to dot the canyon and the oak-maple vegetative zone gives way to one dominated by taller stands of trees. Above this, heartier shrubs and forbs that can handle life high on the mountain surround populations of Aspen (Populus tremuloides), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and White Fir (Abies concolor).
